# Gestalt

Gestalt is an open-source knowledge management tool developed by the Tuist team.

## Motivation

We aim to address the following shortcomings of existing tools:
- Bad experience due to not embracing the platform patterns.
- Poor portability due to proprietary graph formats.

## Principles

- **üå± Open source:** The best and long-lasting technological solutions are shaped and built in the open (e.g. Linux).
- **üíª Native:** We adopt every platform patterns and capabilities reusing business logic with Rust-powered cross-platform code.
- **üìù Local first:** Your knowledge is yours, and only yours.
- **‚≠êÔ∏è Extensible:** Enhance the experience and capabilities with extensions.

## Sustainability strategy

We plan to provide a paid storage option that's uses Git repositories under the hood to persist and synchronize changes across the person's devices. Moreover, we'll document and attempt to standardize a knowledge graph format by providing cross-platfom libraries. We expect them to incentivice developers to build new interfaces and contribute to this commodity. We've also chosen the AGPL-3.0 intentionally to ensure Gestalt remains open forever.
